# How Judas Iscariot died:

He surely "knows" this from his three years with Jesus:

> If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)

How ever, the Serpent's greatest lie never changes since the beginning:

> Did God actually say... (Genesis 3:1)

Did God actually say he will forgive us our sins?

Perhaps, but are you one of "us"?

Did God actually say he will cleanse us from all unrighteousness?

Did God actually say "all unrighteousness"?

Perhaps, but are you sure the "all" including this one? You just betrayed the Son of God.

Mat 27:3

> Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.” And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself.

I feel really sorry for Judas not because he betrayed his own savior, because Peter betrayed two times more than he did, but because he didn't understand that he can still be saved. Yes, even if he betrayed his own Lord, he can still be saved!

In God's will, Jesus will be betrayed by one of his apostles. But God never wants anyone to die, he wants all sinners to repent. The only time God wants someone dead is this time: he destined his only son, the one he love, to die, so that whoever believes in him, can live, even the one who killed him. Yes, even Judas. Jesus said himself he will pray for his enemy. And before he died, he did pray for those who killed him:

> Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.

He will always do this because he is faithful.

Believe this, and even Judas will be saved. Even us.

%% 所以若猶大受到永恆的死亡，並不一定是因為背叛耶穌而死的，更根本的原因是因為不信神。
